When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to share my work, or I'm working with more people in the same project and even for backup reasons.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I may want to control what I want to change in the remote repository, also, not making Git automatically stay up-to-date can minimize conflicts if there are more than one person working on the project.
